    h moves the cursor one character to the left.
    j moves the cursor down one line.
    k moves the cursor up one line.
    l moves the cursor one character to the right.
    0 moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
    $ moves the cursor to the end of the line.
    w move forward one word.
    b move backward one word.
    G move to the end of the file.
    gg move to the beginning of the file.
    `. move to the last edit.

Hereâ€™s a handy tip: prefacing a movement command with a number will execute that movement multiple times. So, if you want to move up six lines, enter 6k and Vim will move the cursor up six lines. If you want to move over five words, enter 5w. To move 10 words back, use 10b.

    u will undo the last operation.
